            <h3>Psychologist and Art therapist</h3>
            <p class="centered">2015</p>
            <p>Counselling and support of youth at risk and their families.</p>
            <p> I've been working with children and teenagers manifesting deviant and/or delinquent behaviour, self-control
                issues, showing emotional symptoms and suicidal tendencies, school dropouts and other youth at risk. The
                work with these children consisted of helping them build better coping strategies, teaching them
                adequate social skills and offering emotional support. The work with early married teenagers included
                educating them about the dangers of child marriage and teaching them basic child-raising skills.
                Building trusting relationships with the children was necessary in order to achieve a desired
                outcome.</p>
            <p>The artistic and creative therapy with the children was aimed at helping them build higher self-esteem,
                learn to express themselves in a creative way, as well as learn how to cooperate.</p>
            <p>Since I was working in a team of other professionals, a certain aspect of the work included burnout
                prevention among my colleagues. Giving presentations at schools and kindergartens related to socially
                important issues was another aspect of my job.
            </p>

            <h3>Freelance Visual Artist</h3>
            <p class="centered">2007-2014</p>
            <p>Doing creative freelance work: illustration, digital painting, making handmade dolls and accessories
                for sale etc. I had the opportunity to learn how to use a wide variety of applications, such as
                Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. During the same time frame I also started a few online
                businesses which impelled me to be efficient, organized and to think in a customer-oriented
                manner.</p>

            <h3>Sales Assistant</h3>
            <p class="centered">1998-2007</p>
            <p>While getting my education, I was working as a sales assistant in retail, which at the time didn’t strike
                my fancy, but in the long run proved invaluable for acquiring relevant interpersonal and communication
                skills, as well as good work ethic.</p>
